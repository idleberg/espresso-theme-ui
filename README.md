# Espresso Theme

This is the first version of the Espresso UI theme for the Atom text editor. My goal in creating this theme was to offer a nice alternative to the usual black/dark gray or white themes. The colors of the theme are inspired by a variety of different espresso drinks. There is still quite a bit to do in terms of improvements, but a syntax theme should be coming along soon as well.
